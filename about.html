    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
        I am a SharePoint and M365-focused software developer with a strong interest in building
        secure, reliable collaboration solutions for enterprise environments. I specialize in
        translating complex technical requirements into solutions that are easy for end users
        and administrators to understand and support.
    </p>

    <p>
        My work emphasizes availability, security, and maintainability—especially in regulated
        or mission-driven organizations where reliability matters.

    <h2>Enterprise Mindset</h2>
    <p>
        I approach development with an enterprise mindset—considering long-term maintenance,
        security posture, and user impact. I understand that successful solutions are not just
        functional, but also supportable, auditable, and aligned with organizational standards.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am comfortable working closely with administrators, vendors, and customers to
        troubleshoot issues, manage expectations, and continuously improve collaboration tools.

    <h2>Why SharePoint & M365</h2>
    <p>
        SharePoint and the Power Platform provide powerful, secure building blocks that allow
        organizations to move fast without sacrificing governance. I enjoy leveraging these
        tools to solve real business problems while staying aligned with modern DevSecOps
        principles.
